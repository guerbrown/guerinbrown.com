                <h3>Research and Interests</h3>
                <p>I am interested in the evolution and speciation of insects. Most are host-associated, living and reproducing almost exclusively on plants or other animals. These life strategies in insects, phytophagy and parasitism, account for roughly 40% of the described animal diversity on Earth. One explanation for why there are so many host-associated insects is divergent ecological speciation, which drives insect species to use different hosts. Trade-offs between ancestral and derived host environments can lead to divergent selection on traits in those two habitats, which can result in reproductive isolating barriers (RIBs) that catalyze speciation. In this context, traits under divergent selection that can lead to RIBs can be behavioral, temporal (e.g., life history traits), morphological, or a combination of traits. While these mechanisms have been studied in some detail in single host-parasite systems, it is not clear how variation among parasites and hosts affects the likelihood and specific drivers of speciation. One way to address this is to study many parasites interacting with many hosts at the same time and ask whether these different parasites diversify in response to changes in the same ecological dimensions. In other words, are the "rules" the same for all parasites?</p>
                <p>I am working to address this question in oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini), which form atypical growths on plants. These "galls" are the result of the female gall wasp depositing eggs into the plant tissue, and the growth serves to protect the offspring until it develops. The gall is thus a perfect environment for development, which entices invaders. And, in fact, hundreds of species of parasites are found in these galls. Some are kleptoparasites which eat the plant material the gall is made of. Others are parasitoids which feed on the gall wasp inside or the kleptoparasites. Others are hyperparasitoids which feed on the parasitoids. I am interested in how these feeding ecologies function with the host ecological dimensions (i.e. the shape, size, color, etc. of the gall) to drive speciation. Rather, do the ecological dimensions matter in the speciation of different parasites, possibly as a result of how an organisms interacts with a resource. </p>
                <p>To do this, I am collecting galls from all across the United States of America.

                <h4>New Paper!</h4>
                <div class="post-meta">July 30, 2025</div>
                <p>Just a couple of weeks ago, I published a paper in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. The focus is on non-native oak gall parasitoid wasps in the genus <i>Bootanomyia</i>. We recorded evidence of these wasps in the Ward et al., 2020 paper in Zoological Studies but didn't have enough data at the time to discern whether there was an unexplored native population or if the wasps were actually introduced. Well, last summer a few more appeared in our rearing cups but from a the other side of the continent from our previous findings. That led us to ask a few questions. 1) Are these non-native? 2) Where is their ancestral population from? 3) Does it really matter if it is a non-native parasitoid. We address all of these questions in the paper.</i></p>

                <p>Title: Discovery of two Palearctic <i>Bootanomyia</i> Girault (Hymenoptera, Megastigmidae) parasitic wasp species introduced to North America</p>
                <p> Invasive species are among the greatest threats to ecosystems, but our ability to detect species introductions varies across taxa. Parasitoid wasps, though one of the most species-rich groups of all animals, are small and have ephemeral adult stages, such that they often go unnoticed. Here, we document two separate introductions of European parasitoids of oak gall wasps into North America. Both wasps key morphologically to <i>Bootanomyia dorsalis</i> (Fabricus), which previous genetic data from Europe suggest comprises two distinct species, B. dorsalis sp. 1 and B. dorsalis sp. 2. We find B. dorsalis sp. 1 in oak galls from New York, USA and B. dorsalis sp. 2 in oak galls from Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, Canada. All oak gall wasp hosts were North American natives. We detect no genetic variation at the mtCOI locus within <i>B. dorsalis</i> sp. 2 specimens, suggesting this introduction may have had only a small number of founder individuals. In their native ranges, both species attack several different gall wasp hosts, and we likewise reared both from galls of multiple North American gall wasp hosts, suggesting a potential for widespread impact on North American gall insect communities. These introductions were detected only because our research groups are actively sampling and identifying parasitoid communities across gall habitats. Most parasitoid communities are not regularly sampled across hosts, time and space, or are well characterized, such that many more undetected wasp introductions may be impacting native insects worldwide. </p>

                <h4>Entomology 2024!</h4>
                <div class="post-meta">November 7, 2024</div>
                <p>I will be at Entomology 2024 in Pheonix, AZ! I'll be presenting on some work with <i>Euceroptres</i> parasites (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) in oak galls. We have genetic and micro-CT evidence to support reconsidering their ecological niche. The talk is Monday November 11th at 8:40am in 222B, PCC.</p>

                <p>Title: Reconsidering the ecological niche of Euceroptres (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) parasites of oak galls using dissection, micro-CT, and genetic barcoding</p>
                <p> Abstract: Insect galls are atypical growths of plant tissue initiated by an ovipositing insect. The resulting structure functions as a larval nursery, providing necessary food and shelter for the insect offspring. Galls formed by wasps on oaks (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) are frequently invaded by at least eleven genera of parasites that exploit the nutritive resource of either the gall or the larvae inside. These parasites may function as parasitoids, kleptoparasites, or hyperparasites which, respectively, feed either on the larva inside the gall, the gall tissue itself, or other parasites. However, for many North American oak-gall-associated genera, the dietary preference or ecological niche is unknown or poorly documented. Here we describe the ecology of oak gall parasites in the genus Euceroptres (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), long assumed to be kleptoparasites. We searched for changes to internal gall structural and physical interactions between larvae using dissections. We DNA barcoded interacting organisms using mtCOI. We scanned a subset of galls using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) to assess the spatial orientation and size of internal regions of the gall where Euceroptres parasites were present. Unlike confirmed oak gall kleptoparasites that create separate chambers within the gall tissue, we find Euceroptres parasites exclusively in otherwise unaltered gall wasp chambers. This suggests that Euceroptres are either parasitizing or otherwise replacing the inducing gall wasp. </p>
